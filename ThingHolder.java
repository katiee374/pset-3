/**
 * Instructions:
 * Write the following class to represent a collection of Thing objects
 * (actors, rooms, or treasures). It should have an instance variable that 
 * is an ArrayList of type Thing, as well as any other variables you see fit. 
 * In the toString method, describe the list as well as all the Things within 
 * it. In the constructor, call super() to set the name and description.
 * ThingHolder can extend class Thing because it has a name and description.
 * 
 * Finally, add a description of the class and update the author and version 
 * tags.
